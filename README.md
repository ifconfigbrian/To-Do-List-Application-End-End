This is a full-stack todo list application,at first i am working on the user interface but we will get there.....

Problem: I need help organizing tasks and prioritizing what needs to be done first,i forget some stuff so this is for me..

    Languages: JavaScript (React), Python (Django)
    
    Solution: Create a task management app that ranks tasks by urgency and importance (using a priority matrix) and sends reminders.
        Features: Task prioritization (e.g., using the Eisenhower matrix), due date notifications, integrations with calendars, and progress tracking.
